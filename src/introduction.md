A React UI component library that is built to simulate **macOS Big Sur**.

### [Install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-big-sur/)
```bash
npm install react-big-sur
```

### [Demo](https://joeyonng.github.io/)
```jsx
<iframe 
  src="https://joeyonng.github.io/" 
  width="100%" 
  height="900"
  style={{
    border: "none",
  }}
/>
```

### [Development](https://github.com/Joeyonng/react-big-sur)
Currently, this project is entirely for learning purposes, and I highly recommend not to use this library in any
real-world applications. This library was never formally tested and may not have support for lots of use cases
(Typescript, mobile browsers, etc.).

I will continue to devote my time on this project until I am satisfied with the final form. The final goal is to make
all the components listed in apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/visual-index/)
available in this library.

All issues/questions/suggestions/criticism are welcome!
