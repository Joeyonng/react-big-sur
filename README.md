# react-big-sur

A React UI component library that is built to simulate **macOS Big Sur**.

Demo:

### Why
This project entirely came out from my attempt to build my personal website as a clone of the macOS Big Sur interface. 
All the components currently built are/will be used in my [website](https://joeyonng.github.io/). This library was still
in the early stage of the development (and with high probability will never be finished). 

Currently, this project is entirely for learning purposes, and I highly recommend not to use this library in any 
real-world applications. This library was never formally tested and may not have support for lots of use cases 
(Typescript for example). 

### Install
```bash
npm install react-big-sur
```

### Features
* [X] Dock, Widgets and Notifications are supported out of the box.
* [X] Various styles of Buttons and Lists.
* [X] Windows that support dragging and resizing thanks to [react-rnd](https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd).
* [X] Animations built with [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/).

### Development
I will continue to devote my time on this project until I am satisfied with the final form. The final goal is to make
all the components listed in apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/visual-index/)
available in this library.
